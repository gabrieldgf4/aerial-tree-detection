# aerial_tree_detection
It is a method for detecting and segmenting treetops, delineating shaded areas and indicating the source of the light source.

This project presents the SCC method for the refinement of disparity maps. It is related to the research field of stereo vision in which we can estimate depth information from a pair of images.
